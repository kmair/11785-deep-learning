# Speech Recognition
---
Using PyTorch, a bi-directional LSTM was used to train a Speech Recognition (speech-to-text) system. 

The implementation and problem description is provided [here](https://github.com/kmair/deep-learning/blob/master/Speech_Recognition_HW/Frame%20Level%20Classification%20of%20Speech.docx).

The speech corpus data being >7 Gb cannot be uploaded here. It contains dev (development), test and train data.
